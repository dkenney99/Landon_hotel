### 3. Cloud Deployment Writeup
If I were entrusted with deploying this current multithreaded Spring application to the cloud I would use the Google Cloud platform and deploy it through their Google App Engine.
The steps I would take would go as follows: 
- 1. Take my depoloyable JAR file through the maven clean package command
- 2. Install the Google Cloud SDK to set up the tools necessary for deploying my application to the Google Cloud, such as gcloud and gsutil
- 3. App Engine uses an app.yaml file to describe an application's deployment configuration, therefore I would set the runtime environment as well as the instance class
- 4. From there, I could deploy the app with the "gcloud app browse" and explore my app on the web

The reason I chose Google Cloud Platforms is because it is a great option for deploying any Spring Boot application because of its scalability, robustness, and the range of other services it offers that integrate well with Google App Engine. These include Google Cloud SQL for databases, Google Cloud Storage for file storage, Google Kubernetes Engine for containerized applications, and Google Cloud Functions for serverless computing.
